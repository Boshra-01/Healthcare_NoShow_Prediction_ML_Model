# Healthcare_NoShow_Prediction_ML_Model

## Overview
A Machine Learning project to predict patient no-shows for medical appointments using Random Forest Classifier.
This project aims to predict whether a patient will show up for a scheduled medical appointment or not, using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information such as patient demographics, appointment details and past medical conditions. The goal is to build a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier to assist healthcare providers in reducing no-show appointments, as well as improving operational efficiency and resource allocation. The project also involves data preprocessing, feature engineering and model evaluation.

## About the dataset:
The pre-processed cleaned dataset includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
